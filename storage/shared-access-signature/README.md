SAS enables you to:

- Delegate access to service-level operations that are not currently available with a service-specific SAS, such as the Get/Set Service Properties and Get Service Stats operations.

- Delegate access to more than one service in a storage account at a time. For example, you can delegate access to resources in both the Blob and File services with an account SAS.

- Delegate access to write and delete operations for containers, queues, tables, and file shares, which are not available with an object-specific SAS.

- Specify an IP address or range of IP addresses from which to accept requests.

- Specify the HTTP protocol from which to accept requests (either HTTPS or HTTP/HTTPS).
