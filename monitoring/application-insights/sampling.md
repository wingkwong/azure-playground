# Sampling

## Adaptive Sampling

Adjusts data sent from the SDK and your app (Default)

## Fixed-rate Sampling

You set the rate and client and server synchronize sampling rate

## Ingestion Sampling

Configure in the portal and discards some data as it arrives from your app, but does not reduce traffic (but does reduce stroage requirements and hence cose)
